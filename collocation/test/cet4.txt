  It is necessay for our college students to get to know  outside the campus.In the campus, we
can learn knowledge from books.Although, in the society we can learn much what we can't in the campus.
There are many ways to know outside the campus.For example,social activity,social practice,social
service,and so on.In these ways,we can get know the society more widely .We all know the fact that 
social experience is acting an important role in our life.As a college students,we should take more time 
on knowing the society.When i graduate,i will know more information and achieve greater skill than others who 
don't go outside the campus.People all build a hope that they could earn their life with the course they
studied in campus.So that i could pay less effort to enter a pleasant job.
